## The script for Verbatim on Tabletop Simulator.

![Preview 1](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1052100251215004505/84B6B0220FF779F881330E872E94B796989B433D/)

Verbatim is a game where you (and your team) must guess as many cards in a deck in 3 different limiting rounds. (Explain, 1 word, & Draw). The possibilities are endless. Themed decks and custom card creation is also at your fingertips. Can't decide? Play with the 7,000+ card Vanilla deck. All cards are loaded from a server so you do not have to load the cards yourself onto Tabletop Simulator in bulk.

*To modify the code and push it into the game:*

Requires Atom Editor and the Tabletop Simulator package. See http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/atom-editor-plugin/ for full details.

In the Settings for Packages->tabletopsimulator-lua, make sure the 'Insert other files specified in source code' box is checked.

Set the 'Base path for files you wish to #include' to the local parent folder of this repository.

For example, if you have this repository saved in 'D:\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Scripts\Verbatim', set the base path to 'D:\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Scripts'

If you want to edit the scripts directly from the temp folder, uncheck the 'Insert other files specified in source code' box and reload the scripts in Atom.

The mod is made by Hael, LobstersArentImmortal and Platypus.
